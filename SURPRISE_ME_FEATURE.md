### Data Storage

```typescript

interface DailyRollData {
  remaining: number;
  history: DailyRoll[];
}

// Stored in localStorage with key: `dailyRolls_${dateString}`
```

### Roll Generation Algorithm

1. **Archetype Detection**: Uses existing `getSolarArchetype()` function
2. **Activity Filtering**: Removes recently rolled activities (last 10)
3. **Weighted Selection**: Applies rarity weights (60/30/10)
4. **Unique ID Generation**: Ensures no duplicate rolls

### Rarity Distribution

- **Common (60%)**: Everyday activities, easy to complete
- **Rare (30%)**: More involved experiences, higher impact
- **Legendary (10%)**: Transformative resources, breakthrough opportunities

## UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with max-width containers
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### User Flow
