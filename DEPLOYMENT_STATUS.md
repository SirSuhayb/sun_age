- Status: According to conversation, this wallet was funded but private key not in current .env

## üîß **NEXT STEPS**

### Option 1: Use Original Funded Wallet
1. Add the private key for `0xECA1043ecB95d7cec532709D64c3078b7CC8E167` to `.env` file
2. Run deployment immediately (should have 0.01 ETH + 2.1B SOLAR)

### Option 2: Fund Current Wallet
1. Send 0.01 ETH to `0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf`
2. Send 2.1B SOLAR to `0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf`
3. Run deployment

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT COMMAND**
Once wallet is funded:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base
```

## üìä **EXPECTED DEPLOYMENT ACTIONS**
1. Deploy SolarUtility contract (with USDC payment system)
2. Deploy SolarStaking contract (with emission schedule)
3. Deploy MorphoTreasury contract (with auto-Morpho deposits)
4. **Link contracts together** (SolarUtility ‚Üí MorphoTreasury)
5. Fund staking with 500K SOLAR rewards
6. Execute 2B SOLAR strategic burns (2% supply reduction)
7. **Revenue Flow Ready**: USDC sales ‚Üí Treasury ‚Üí Morpho yield
8. Save deployment addresses to `deployment-results.json`

## üéØ **DEPLOYMENT IMPACT**
- **Immediate Burns**: 2B SOLAR (2% supply reduction)
- **Staking Setup**: 500K SOLAR reward pool
- **Premium Features**: 7 tiers (30M-500M SOLAR requirements)
