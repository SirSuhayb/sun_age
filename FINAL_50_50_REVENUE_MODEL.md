## 🚀 **Smart Contract Implementation**

### **SolarUtility.sol Updates**
```solidity
// 50/50 Revenue Split
uint256 morphoShare = balance / 2;
uint256 companyShare = balance - morphoShare;

// Send to Morpho Treasury (holder benefits)
USDC.transfer(morphoTreasuryContract, morphoShare);

// Send to Company Treasury (business revenue)  
USDC.transfer(companyTreasuryContract, companyShare);
```

### **MorphoTreasury.sol Updates**
```solidity
// Holder-Focused Yield Distribution
uint256 stakingYield = (newYield * 4000) / 10000;  // 40%
uint256 burnYield = (newYield * 3000) / 10000;     // 30%
uint256 airdropYield = (newYield * 2000) / 10000;  // 20%
uint256 devYield = (newYield * 1000) / 10000;      // 10%
```
