## 📊 Tokenomics Impact

### Supply Changes
- **Starting Supply**: 100B SOLAR
- **Immediate Burns**: 2B SOLAR (2% reduction)
- **Remaining**: 98B SOLAR
- **Future Burns**: 25% of revenue quarterly

### Staking Emissions
- **Monthly Emission**: 50,000 SOLAR (declining 2%/month)
- **Year 1 Total**: ~588K SOLAR (~0.6% of supply)
- **5-Year Total**: ~1.78M SOLAR (~1.8% of supply)

### Revenue Projections
Conservative revenue model targeting $600K-3M+ annually:
- Premium features: $50K-1.5M/year
- Treasury yield: $5K-500K/year
- Platform fees: $25K-750K/year
- Partnerships: $55K-250K/year

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Check Premium Access
```javascript
// Check if user can access premium analytics
const hasAccess = await solarUtility.checkAccess(
    userAddress, 
    ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes("premium_analytics"))
);
```

### Stake SOLAR Tokens
```javascript
// Stake 50M SOLAR (Bronze tier)
const amount = ethers.parseEther("50000000");
await solarToken.approve(stakingAddress, amount);
await solarStaking.stake(amount);
```

### Check Staking Rewards
```javascript
// Check pending rewards
const rewards = await solarStaking.calculatePendingRewards(userAddress);
console.log(`Pending rewards: ${ethers.formatEther(rewards)} SOLAR`);
```

### Treasury Operations
```javascript
// Deposit USDC to Morpho for yield
const usdcAmount = ethers.parseUnits("10000", 6); // 10K USDC
await morphoTreasury.depositToMorpho(usdcAmount);
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Burns**: Total SOLAR burned vs remaining supply
2. **Staking**: APY, total staked, tier distribution  
3. **Features**: Usage analytics, premium adoption
4. **Treasury**: USDC balance, Morpho yield, APY
5. **Price**: SOLAR price appreciation from utility

### Dashboard Ideas
- Real-time burn counter
- Staking APY calculator
